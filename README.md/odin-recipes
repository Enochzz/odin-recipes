Basically, this is a new project that will concentarate on 
basics of building a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
and i strongly believe that at the end of this project i should be able to comfortably use the aforementioned tools to build a basic or simple website.
and also should be able to push it to the GitHub professionally.
